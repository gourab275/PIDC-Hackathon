            "The Tata Safari, a beloved vehicle making a comeback after two decades, has been redesigned with a new generation. This new model, built on the Land Rover platform, shares similarities with the Harrier but offers subtle differences in design. The interior boasts an upmarket feel with advanced tech features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The car provides ample space with a third row, though access can be cumbersome. The Safari offers a spacious cargo area when the second and third-row seats are folded. It is powered by a 2.0-liter turbo-diesel engine available in manual and automatic transmissions. The driving experience is smooth, with notable differences between Eco and Sport modes. Safety features include dual airbags, ABS, hill hold control, and traction control, with top variants offering 6 airbags and more. The Safari is expected to be competitively priced against rivals like the MG Hector Plus and Toyota Innova Crysta.\n",

The Safari is 4661mm long, 1786mm high (80mm more than the Harrier due to its stepped roof design), 1894mm wide, and has a wheelbase of 2741mm, which is the same as the Harrier. The design cues are similar to the Harrier, but the Safari has subtle differences like a distinct front grille with Tata's 'tri-arrow' motif and more chrome detailing. The Safari is available in three color options - Royale Blue, Daytona Grey, and Orcus White. The interior is upmarket with an 'Oyster White' theme and features a spacious cabin with a massive panoramic sunroof. The cabin also includes a dual-tone black and white dash and an 8.8-inch floating island touchscreen system that is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\""
